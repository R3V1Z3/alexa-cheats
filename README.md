# Alexa Cheats
This is an attempt at an exhaustive compilation of commands, questions and Easter eggs for Amazon Alexa. The goal is to keep them neatly contained in a plain text file where the contents can be printed with ease so I've opted to rely on Markdown for print-friendly formatting meanwhile also providing a web-accessible front-end that adds helpful features for easy browsing on the web.

Web-accessible front-end here:  
https://ugotsta.github.io/alexa-cheats/

The front-end provides an info panel to help with navigation. It can be hidden by pressing <kbd>?</kbd> or <kbd>h</kbd>.

Url parameters can be used for added control:

Up to 4 columns are currently allowed. Sections can be dragged around (kudos to the [Dragula](https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/) project devs) for easier access and especially for getting things neatly arranged before printing.

## Command format
The alexa-cheats.md file holds all the key details (commands, questions, etc). The file follows standard Markdown rules along with the following for best practice.

Commands are arranged in sections with a descriptive header:  
`## Time and Date`

Each command should be added under headers as unordered list items using '- ':  
`- Command.`

Emphases (asterisks) are used to designate authors, song/movie titles and other special notes:  
`"Alexa, do you know Hal?" *- 2001*`

Strong emphases (double underscores) and forward slashes designate variations:  
`__Hawaii/Paris/London__`
