# Alexa Cheats
This is an attempt at an exhaustive compilation of commands, questions and Easter eggs for Amazon Alexa. The goal is to keep them neatly contained in a plain text file where the contents can be printed with ease so I've opted to rely on Markdown for print-friendly formatting meanwhile also providing a web-accessible front-end that parses and adds helpful features for easy browsing on the web.

Web-accessible front-end here:

The front-end provides an info panel to help with navigation. It can be hidden by pressing '?' or 'h'.  

Url parameters can be used for extra control:

## Command format
The alexa-cheats.md file holds all the key details (commands, questions, etc). The file follows standard Markdown rules along with the following for best practice.

Commands are arranged in sections with descriptive header:
`## Time and Date`

Each command should be added as an unordered list item using '- ':  
`- Command.`

Use emphases (asterisks) to designate authors, song/movie titles and other special notes:  
`"Alexa, do you know Hal?" *- 2001*`

Use strong emphases in Markdown (double underscore) and forward slashes to designate variations:  
`__Hawaii/Paris/London__`
